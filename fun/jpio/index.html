  <article class="post-content">
    <h3 id="what-is-it">What is it</h3>
<p>Json Python IO is a command line utility to read/write json data.
It started out as a simple idea to read and write json files via command line.
As I started working on it, I soon wonder how much I can pushed it.
It has now become a query/transformation language for json.</p>

<h3 id="existing-implementations">Existing implementations</h3>
<p>I found a few existing implementation that are good, like <a href="http://stedolan.github.io/jq/">‘json’</a> (written in node), and <a href="https://github.com/jingweno/jqplay">jq</a>.
However, I wanted a implementation I can modify and add new stuffs to.
So as usual, I decided to tackle the problem.</p>

<h3 id="logs">Logs</h3>

<h4 id="jan-11-17">2015 Jan 11-17</h4>
<p>Drafted a language spec. It can be found <a href="/fun/jpio/query-spec/">here</a>.
In the same spec, I will also write what are the expected output.
With this out of the way, I think I will begin implementing it.</p>

<h4 id="jan-05">2015 Jan 05</h4>
<p>Been thinking about how and what the feature of JPIO should be and how much it should do.
Rewrite the parser and runtime about 3 times, each time was forced to rewrite again due to feature creep.</p>

<h4 id="jan-02">2015 Jan 02</h4>
<p>I have manage to hack up an quick version to test if i am capable of doing something like that.
The existing version can be found at <a href="https://github.com/ZwodahS/jpio">github</a>.</p>

<p>However, there are a lot of things that I wanted to be in the program that requires a complete rewrite of the parser and runtime.
So instead of implementing it straight away, the documentation <a href="/fun/jpio/query-doc/">here</a> will describe all the query that I want to be in jpio.</p>

<h3 id="current-thoughts">Current thoughts</h3>
<p>The scope of the projects exploded and I am not sure if I can finish it =).
The code on github is usable but does less than what jq does.
I am still looking into how to parse and how the runtime will be implemented.</p>

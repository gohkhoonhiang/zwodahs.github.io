    <p><code>(August 2012 - August 2014)</code></p>

<h2 id="how-it-begin">How it begin</h2>

<p>The journey began when I finished my job as a research assistant.
I wasn’t sure about what to do next.
I didn’t want to have a normal job, fearing that it will drain the passion out of me.
I looked back into my past, seeking the thing that I loved - Games.</p>

<h2 id="the-journey">The Journey</h2>

<p>I started with the <a href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/">LibGdx</a>, a Java game library meant for mobile and desktop.
It was simple and Java was the language that I was comfortable back then.
I didn’t really make any game for Libgdx at that time, just toying around with basic concepts.</p>

<p>I started playing with XNA soon after, as I wanted to move to desktop games instead of mobile.
After playing with XNA for a month or two, I realized I really hate coding on windows.</p>

<p>The next api I chose was C++/<a href="http://www.sfml-dev.org/">SFML</a>.
To be honest, choosing this was one of the best decision I have made so far.
To explain why, let me tell you the backstory.</p>

<p>Prior to that day, I had always believed that C++ is hard and have been avoiding it since I started programming.
However, after I started my knowledge obsession, I had became quite fearless.
With that fearless mentality, I decided to conquer this long fear of mine to “prove” my determination.</p>

<p>So why is it the best decision?
Because of it, I started using <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a> a lot.
Although I did use vim prior to that during my research, it was during the time that I use C++ that I really became very good at <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a>.
I also learnt a few other stuffs, bash, git, to name a few.
And most importantly, I conquered the fear.</p>

<p>After conquering the fear, I realized that I could learn many things if I put my heart to it.</p>

<p>I used C++ for at least one and a half years.
Most of the games can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/ZwodahS">github</a> account.
Some of the games are also listed in this blog or will be listed in the future.
I also wrote a <a href="/tutorial/lua/">Lua Integration Tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>I had also published a game on the android, a simple <a href="https://github.com/ZwodahS/memorysquares">memory game</a>.
It was prototyped in C++ in a day and I really like the concept.
After playtesting with my friends for about a month, I made the android version and released it on playstore.
It might have been taken down by now though.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-ended">How it ended</h2>

<p>After writing games for many months, participating in many ludum dare(s), I was lost.
I couldn’t find an exit. I started looking for job that I could be myself or job that can allow me to make game at the side.
After searching for a few months, I finally found one. 
I decided to end this life earlier than the 3 years I gave myself, beginning my next life.</p>

<p>All the game I made in this life can be found at my <a href="/projects/games">game-project</a> page along with other games that I after that.</p>

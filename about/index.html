  <article class="post-content">
    <h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>I begin my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_(programmer_subculture)">‘hacking’</a> career at around 17, when I took up a diploma in IT in 2003.
The initial motivation to learn computing was to be able to make games, which I eventually did in my <a href="/lifetimes/1/">first life</a>.
I did pretty well in the course and gave me an opportunity to pursuit a Degree(Computer Science) in NUS.</p>

<p>Although I didn’t take a specialized course to make game, the degree in Computer Science turned out to be better choice.
I begin to become interested in Computer Science(CS) in general and began to dive into many areas in CS.</p>

<p>Just before I graduated, I had the intention to take my Ph.D in the same university.
This led me to one of my professor and I began to work as a research assistant under him.
However, as it turns out, I wasn’t really interested in research and I left.</p>

<p>But it turns out, it is only after I left that my <a href="/life/">lifes</a> truely begins.</p>

<h3 id="thoughts-on-life">Thoughts on life</h3>

<p>I have much to say about lifes, so you should check out my <a href="/life/">lifes</a> page.
Yes, the ‘s’ in <a href="/life/">lifes</a> is intentional, and you should check out why.</p>

<h3 id="thoughts-on-knowledge">Thoughts on knowledge</h3>

<p>I wasn’t really interested in learning things when I was young.
As I grow older, I keep learning things as they are needed until one day, I started becoming obsessed with gaining knowledge and learning things.</p>

<p>Previously, I would take lessons and courses that I knew I can do well, or because my friends were in there.
After my mind was ‘opened’, I started taking courses that were interesting to me and even though they seems hard, I didn’t care.</p>

<p>I have my theory on this, which I will eventually write in a separate page.
The sumamry of my theory is that, <code>the more you know, the more you can know</code>.
The realization that there are more things that I can know drives me to learn more, and eventually even more.</p>

<p>I eventually became obsessed with ways to keep the knowledge that I know, fearing that I will lose them eventually.
This blog is just another manifestation of that fear.</p>

<h3 id="thoughts-on-games">Thoughts on games</h3>

<p>I still play quite a bit of games.
There are many theories describing the various type of gamers and I will eventually write one myself.
I believe that knowing what kind of “traps” you will fall into will help you avoid games that are messing with your psychology.</p>

<p>Here are some games that I will recommend at least checking it out.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/">Dwarf fortress</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://en.cataclysmdda.com/">Catacylsm</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.dontstarvegame.com/">Don’t Starve</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.markoftheninja.com/">Mark of the ninja</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I will make this into a separate post once I am done with moving the other stuffs from the old blog over.
I am avoiding putting big names here (ahem Minecraft) since most people should have heard of it by now.
Nevertheless, I will eventually create a list of games, be it flash, indie, ludum dare games that I enjoyed.</p>

<h3 id="contact-me">Contact me</h3>

<p>I am quite reluctant to give my email but for people who are really interested, you should be able to dig it out.
If you want to contact me for any reason, you can get me through twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/ZwodahS">@ZwodahS</a>.</p>
